mathquill
---------
- supported by Desmos
    - very inactive dev the last two years
- bugs so far
    - comment on this chrome issue with a minal repro some day
        - reports as an incorrect end of input on line 1
        - currebnt repro, in demo.html
        - delete the last line below - });
            $(function() {
              $('.mathquill-static-math').each(function() { MathQuill.StaticMath(this); });
              $('.mathquill-math-field').each(function() { MathQuill.MathField(this); });
              $('.mathquill-text-field').each(function() { MathQuill.TextField(this); });
            });
    - can delete the elements out of the upper bounds of integral
        - cannot figure out a way to get back to add something else, have to edit the raw latex
    - backspace on empty upper bounds of summation deletes the summation itself and leaves
      the lower bounds alone such as n=5
    - navigation around nested fractions
        -\frac{\frac{12}{3}}{\frac{4}{5}}
        - move from the bottom-most denominstor to the top, mvoe left or right on the top
          number, going down again it will skip the second from the bottom during traversal
            - does not happen just going up/down repeatedly
            - some state is lost when moving hoizonatally 
- testing
    - combining mathquill with dd-slick fancy dropdown
        - issues with styles wrong on square roots
        - style for transform is applied by mathquill, seems to be dependant on
          font size, I think I'm not handling its relationship to the dom correclty
            - can fix it on the page by getting rid of the transform property
            - fixed for now with hardcoded valeus fro scaling
    - \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt5}{5x^2}}{\\int_{0}^{5} x dx}
- exploring the source
    - math.js
        - abstract classes for math blocks and commands
            - these concepts don't seems to be sufficient to describe needed concepts
        - 
        // what does __slice do? where are the arguments comming from?
        //  - fiured it out, just an alias for [].slice();
        // arguments is always available in function scope, give complete arg
        // list, including those not bound to parameters if more we passed than
        // the function is written to take 

added a new public API to get all supported symbols
    - looks to be returning duplicates
        - there are multiple aliases mapped to one latx symbol
    - not actually filtering out all of the letters that are not rendering in
      the dropdown
        - looking at the hosted demo, it looks like it doesn't support symbols
          like capital \Mu
            - either my code is broken, or this symbol is registered with MAthquill
              but having difficulty rendering even outside of the dropdown
                - typing \Mu in the hosted offical demo creates a non-italics word literal
                    - can produce the same thing by putting \hello
